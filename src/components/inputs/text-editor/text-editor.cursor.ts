/* The caret, drawn on a side that does not depend on how it got there.
 *
 * CodeMirror draws a cursor at `coordsAtPos(head, assoc)`, and `assoc` records
 * the direction the caret arrived from: from the left it measures the right edge
 * of the glyph before the position, from the right the left edge of the glyph
 * after it. For upright text those edges coincide. For italics they do not, since
 * a slanted glyph overhangs its own advance, and Safari rounds each edge to a
 * whole pixel on top of that. Arrow left and arrow right onto the same position
 * then land the caret a pixel apart, which reads as a caret that will not stay
 * put.
 *
 * At a widget (a link badge) or a line wrap the two sides are genuinely
 * different places and the direction must decide. So the rule is not "always
 * one side" but "one side, unless the sides are far enough apart to mean
 * something". And a link badge, a widget on one document position, is made to
 * feel like a character of its own that cannot be edited: a click lands on the
 * side you clicked, the arrow keys step from one side of it to the other,
 * Backspace and Delete step over it rather than eating past it, and text goes
 * to the side of the badge it was typed on. */

 *  pointer, and would land left of a badge you clicked right of), and by an
