/* Emphasis that holds while you type inside it.
 *
 * CommonMark's flanking rules decide whether a `**` opens or closes, and a
 * closing run may not follow whitespace. So `**woord**` is bold and, the moment
 * a space is typed before the closing markers, `**woord **` is not: the line
 * falls back to plain text (the weight, the markers' size, the line height)
 * until the next letter arrives. A bold sentence flickers on every word
 * boundary (#213).
 *
 * The parse is right; showing it that eagerly is not. So the emphasis the caret
 * is in is remembered, and while the caret stays between its markers the styling
 * is held whatever the parser says. When the hold ends (the caret leaves, the
 * editor blurs, a paragraph break cuts the run) the whitespace that broke it is
 * moved outside the markers, `**woord** `. That is what wrapping a selection
 * produces too (#212), so bold made by typing and bold made by selecting end
 * the same. */
