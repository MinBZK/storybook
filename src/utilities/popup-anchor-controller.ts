/**
 * Shared wiring for a control that invokes a slotted overlay (`nldd-menu` /
 * `nldd-popover`): it adopts the overlay from a slot, anchors it, and turns the
 * control's clicks into open/close.
 *
 * A controller rather than a mixin, because the parts that differ between
 * nldd-button, nldd-icon-button and nldd-split-button are configuration, not
 * subclassing: the anchor target (the host, or an inner wrapper) is a callback,
 * and the click handling is a method the control calls from its own handler,
 * which then falls through to its own form / link / event behaviour. Split-button
 * layers `toggle` tracking on top via `onChange`, which composition allows and
 * inheritance would fight.
 *
 * The delicate part it centralises is the pointerdown snapshot. The browser
 * light-dismisses an open popover on pointerdown, which is *before* the click
 * lands, so a click handler that only sees "the overlay is closed" would
 * immediately re-open what the same gesture just dismissed (the "flashes closed
 * then reopens" bug). Snapshotting on pointerdown keeps the two apart.
